# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity or policy violations. It analyzes data packets traveling across a network and flags potential threats. This project uses a machine learning approach to classify network traffic as either 'normal' or 'anomalous'.
